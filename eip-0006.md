### Background And Motivation

Ergo is a blockchain designed for long-term survivability, resilience to attacks and
security. To facilitate these goals the following parameters of the network should be
optimized:
- Blockchain storage size on full nodes
- Speed of Block Candidate assembly from pooled transactions
- transaction validation speed (txs/sec) 
- minimal network traffic required for a node to stay connected and keep the pace of the
blockchain growth (obtaining new blocks, broadcasting new candidates)
- Node memory footprint 

One of the opportunities to improve the network is to exploit the _stable_ nature of many
useful contract templates (Here _stability_ means the new versions of the contracts are
not created very often, if created at all):
1) Ergo uses many contracts as part of its core protocol like
`feeProposition`, `rewardOutputScript`, `foundationScript` etc. The contracts are fixed
and are not supposed to be changed. 
2) Many contracts such as those used in ErgoMix, DEX, Crowd Funding, etc. may become
widely reusable. Many applications may be created on top of them. Such contracts have a
natural tendency to be stable to keep backward compatibility with applications that use
them.
3) Stability of contracts also plays well with security. Intuitively, it feels very
unsafe to send coins to an unknown contract. On the other hand, it is generally safe to
send coins to the _well-known_ contracts, which have well described properties,
verified by community experts and signed by network developers (or Foundation board
members).

However, despite the actual stability of many contracts, in the Ergo Protocol v1 their
copies have to be saved in thousands of transactions and UTXO boxes which they protect.
This significantly increases the blockchain size and UTXO memory footprint. It also have
significant computational overhead due to parsing and cost limit control.

This Ergo Improvement Proposal standardizes the protocol extension to factor those
well-known contracts out of serializable boxes, transactions, blocks and finally out of the
blockchain storage. It also allows to reduce validation time of both new block candidates
and broadcasted blocks.

### Well-known Contract Format
Each _well-known contract_ must be specified and registered as it is described in this section and then
added to the [list in the following section](#well-known-contracts-list).

To specify a new well-known contract one needs:

1) Obtain the last registered well-known contract from [the list of well-known
contracts](#well-known-contracts-list).

1) Obtain `lastContractId` and the current counter value `C` from the most recent contract
registration record.

1) Describe the contract template according to [EIP-0005](eip-0005.md) and obtain its
serialized bytes `contractBytes`. We impose an additional requirement that the number of
segregated constants of the contract template is equal to the number of parameters. This
is important to allow the same template (with exactly the same bytes) to be reused across
many different ErgoTree instances of well-known contracts.

1) Sign the "lastContractId|contractBytes" bytes with `Foundation Signature` (which can be
a threshold `2-out-of-6` or similar signature) and obtain `signatureBytes`.

1) Add a new contract registration data as a sub-section of the [next
section](#well-known-contracts-list) using the data described in th

1) Obtain a new `contractId` bytes by running `Blake2b256((C+1)|lastContractId|contractBytes|signatureBytes)`

Column           | Value              | Description
-----------------|--------------------|------------------
`contractId`     | `contractId`       | The hash of the contract registration content 
`contractCode`   | C + 1              | The next code of the contract
`prevContractId` | `lastContractId`   | The hash of the previous registered contract 
`contractBytes`  | `Base16` or `File` | Contract Template bytes according to [EIP-0005](eip-0005.md) 
`contractSig`    | `Base16` or `File` | The `signatureBytes` as Base16

### Well-known Contracts List

Each well-known contract must be added here in a sub-section and described according to
the [well-known contract format](#well-known-contract-format). Each contract refers to the
previous contract using its id thus forming a chain of contract registrations. The
consistency of the whole chain and signatures can be verified by the software implemening
both [EIP-0005](eip-0005.md) and this standard.

#### RewardOutputScript contract

```json
{
  "contractId": "2025692038620398",
  "contractCode": 1,
  "prevContractId": "",
  "contractTemplate": {
    "name": "RewardOutputScript",
    "description": "holds mining rewards",
    "constants": "0204a00b08cd0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798",
    "template": "ea02d192a39a8cc7a70173007301",
    "parameters": [
       { 
         "name": "delta",
         "description": "spending delay",
         "type": "04",
         "placeholder": 0
       }
    ]
  },
  "contractSignature": "11010823470091823840001349712304860891123948601298723" 
}
```

### Implementation of The Standard

The extension is fully encapsulated (localized) in the implementation of ErgoTree and
transparent to the rest of the protocol except cost estimation (see [sub-section
below](#changes-in-costing)). The standard requires extending of the serialization format
of ErgoTree.

#### Changes in Serialization

The `Bit 5` reserved in the `header` of ErgoTree (which is `0` by default, see
[ErgoTree](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf) section _ErgoTree serialization_)
can be set to `1` to indicate the contract is _well-known_. When the `Bit 5`
(`WellKnownContractBit`) is set the `root` slot contains the `contractCode` of one of the
well-known contracts registered in the list above

Slot           | Format      | #bytes   | Description
---------------|-------------|----------|-----
_header_       | VLQ(UInt)   | [1, *]   | The header with `Bit 5` set to 1
...            |             |          | other slots of ErgoTree
root           | VLQ(UInt)   | [1, *]   | `contractCode` of a registered well-known contract

To deserialize the ErgoTree with `WellKnownContractBit == 1` every compliant protocol
implementation should keep a mapping between contract codes and contract templates. When
the `contractCode` is deserialized it can be used to lookup the contract template in the
mapping. Thus obtained contract template is then used as the `root` expression tree of the
ErgoTree instance. The `contractCode` value is also stored in the ErgoTree instance.

Note, that the same well-known contract template instance can be shared across all
ErgoTree instances, since the parameters are all segregated. This not only completely
avoids the deserialization of well-known templates, but also reduces memory footprint (and
GC pressure) during massive transaction processing.

#### Changes in Costing

Cost estimation can be optimized for some of the well-known contracts by associating a
fixed `cost` value with each contract. This association can be stored as `wellKnownCosts`
data in the extensions section of each Block and updated by miners via voting.

When an input is protected by a well-known contract, then `wellKnownCosts` table can be looked
up to quickly obtain script verification cost. This cost can be accumulated to the total
block cost.
