## Background And Motivation

Every unspent box is protected by a contract script, which is stored in the box itself as
serialized [ErgoTree](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf). The script should be
evaluated as part of transaction validation to verify box's spending conditions.

Script verification takes some time and system resources on every network node and thus
both the execution time and the resources need to be put under control. This is known as
cost estimation (or "costing").

Costing is necessary to prevent long delays in verification of new blocks by network
nodes. Both over-sized and over-expensive scripts may be exploited to attack the network
by exhausting verifiers' resources and slowing down network transaction throughput.

There are two general approaches to do cost control: 
1) Ahead-Of-Time Costing (AOTC) - estimation of the execution costs in which the cost of
the script is approximated before and without the actual script execution.
2) Just-In-Time Costing (JITC) - accumulation of the execution cost during
the actual contract execution.

This EIP describes a hybrid JIT+AOT approach for costing of Ergo contracts verification. 

Note, AOTC and JITC approaches are compared in [Appendix
A](#appendix-a-aot-vs-jit-costing) and the potential benefits of JITC are described in
[Appendix B](#appendix-b-benefits-of-jit-costing).

## Ergo Transaction Validation With JIT Costing

This EIP describes a hybrid JIT+AOT approach for costing of Ergo contracts verification,
which uses JIT costing for script reduction to sigma-protocol proposition (aka SigmaProp)
and then uses AOT costing to estimate cost of computationally very expensive cryptographic
operations to verify the SigmaProp proposition.

The hybrid approach allows preventing execution of scripts beyond allotted limits.

The implementation doesn't require changes in the serialization format and
interpretation of transactions in the block. Only cost verification is changed with this
proposal, which however require activation via soft-fork. Thus, the current version of Ergo
Protocol v2 must be increased to v3.

The proposed change is conservative so that the new Ergo Protocol v2 is backward
compatible:
1) All existing applications (like exchanges, ErgoMix, DEX) will not require any changes.
2) The new protocol doesn't incur additional overhead and instead reduce it. 

The cost calculation of ErgoTrees is implemented as it is defined in [the next
section](#new-costing-of-ergotree).

We first describe how transactions of a block are validated. This _on-chain_ validation is
part of the consensus protocol. Transaction validation is a deterministic procedure which
should be the same for all nodes of the network.

Next, we describe the steps which should be done _off-chain_ by applications in order to
create, sign and send new transactions.

### Transaction Verification

The verification is performed by _verifier_ nodes for each new transaction `tx` either
selected from the pool or contained in a new block candidate broadcast over the network.

1) A verifier determines the `costLimit` parameter of the transaction which should be less
than `MaxTxCost`. The limit is computed as `costLimit = tx.feeOut.value /
tx.feeOut.R4[Long]` if the register is not empty, otherwise `costLimit = MaxTxCost`. 
The value in the `R4` register is the NERG price of a unit of cost (`costPrice`).
The `MaxTxCost` parameter is described in the [section below](#maximum-transaction-cost).

2) The transaction `tx` can be added to the block candidate if the currently accrued block
cost `blk.accCost` plus `costLimit` is less than `MaxBlockCost`. Validation of the
block fails immediately after the current `blk.accCost` exceeds `MaxBlockCost`.

3) The verifier validates `tx` performing all the checks of the current Ergo Protocol (v1 at
the time of writing) except verification of scripts and proofs. If the transaction doesn't
pass these checks it is _malformed_ and the verifier rejects it. 

4) All operations performed by the verifier have an associated costs. These costs are
accumulated to the `tx.accCost` parameter and shouldn't exceed `costLimit`. The
`tx.accCost <= costLimit` check is performed every time `tx.accCost` is increased. When
the limit is exceeded the verification is aborted and `tx` is rejected as
_over-limit_ transaction.

5) The initial checks of transaction validity have a cost for verifiers, since verifiers
need to spend computation resources. The cost is accrued to the total transaction cost
`tx.accCost`. If the initial checks pass the transaction is _well-formed_ otherwise the
transaction is rejected.

6) The well-formed transaction is further validated by executing ErgoTrees for all inputs
and verifying the corresponding proofs. The costs of the ErgoTree execution and the
subsequent proofs verification are [computed](#new-costing-of-ergotree) as part of script
evaluation and accrued to the `tx.accCost`. When the validation proceeds from one input to
another the values of `tx.accCost` and `costLimit` are passed to the ErgoTree interpreter
as parameters, so that the validation of the transaction fails immediately after the
current `tx.accCost` exceeds `costLimit`. When it happens `tx` is rejected as
_over-limit_ transaction.

7) If the transaction is successfully verified, the actual cost value
`tx.accCost` is accrued to `blk.accCost`. If the transaction is rejected then: 
- If the verification is part of a new block candidate assembly the `tx` is dropped. 
- If the verification is part of a block verification the whole block is also rejected. 

### Sending Transaction

The following steps are performed by Ergo application _off-chain_.

1) A transaction sender composes a new transaction `tx` and performs signing.
Transaction signing involves: 
   1) Execution of the scripts for all the input boxes.
   2) Execution of sigma protocols to generate proofs. 

    The above two steps are performed using the context of the blockchain at the time when
    `tx` is expected to be added to the block (often the time of transaction signing). In
    general, the current blockchain height, PreHeader and the last 10 block headers can be
    used in the scripts which may influence the result of the scripts.

2) The byproduct of the signing is that `tx.accCost` is computed which is the estimated
cost of executing all the the `tx` scripts in the given blockchain context. If scripts
execution doesn't depend on the current blockchain parameters (like `HEIGHT`, `headers`
etc.) then `tx.accCost` deterministically predicts execution cost in _any_ context which
has additional benefits (see [context-independent scripts](#context-independent-scripts)).

3) When the transaction has a script which _depends_ on the context then the transaction
sender can _optionally_ specify the `costPrice` in the `tx.feeOut.R4` register, which will
be used to compute the `costLimit` of the transaction.

    The `costLimit` parameter is used by the `tx` verifier to reject over-limit
    transactions and should be greater or equal to `tx.accCost` computed during `tx`
    verification.

    If the sender chooses to specify `tx.feeOut.R4` he/she also need to put at least
    `feeLimit = costLimit * costPrice` NERGs (NanoERGs) in the miner's `feeOut` box.
 
4) When `tx` has predictable `tx.accCost` cost (i.e. all input scripts are
context-independent) then `tx` verification will never exceed `tx.accCost`, and thus
setting `feeOut.value = tx.accCost * costPrice` guarantees the transaction is not rejected
as over-limit.

5) When `tx.accCost` is not predictable, which may happen when `tx` has at least one
context-dependent script (i.e. at least one script have conditions on `HEIGHT`,
`CONTEXT.headers`, etc), then the sender can either 1) choose values for `feeOut.value`
and `costPrice` based on estimation, or 2) choose a value for `feeOut.value` and use
`MaxTxCost` for `costPrice` (see [details](#maximum-transaction-cost))

### Maximum Transaction Cost

It is [observed in [2]](#references) that when a script execution requires nontrivial
computation effort, practical attacks exist which either 1) waste minersâ€™ computational
resources or 2) lead miners to accept incorrect script results. This _verifier's dilemma_
drives rational miners to be well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains.
The solution proposed (see [2], Lemma1) incentivizes correct execution of scripts by rational miners
under the condition that miners only accept to verify the transactions that have cost limit
bounded by `MaxTxCost = epsilon * MaxBlockCost / N` where `MaxBlockCost` is the limit on block
verification costs, `N` is the number of transactions in a block and `epsilon` is a
parameter representing the computational advantage of skipping verification (or skipping
probability).

In the case of Ergo we fix `MaxTxCost` (which can be increased via voting) and then
`epsilon = MaxTxCost * N / MaxBlockCost` become dependent on the block.

JITC verification with the fixed `MaxTxCost` satisfy _epsilon-computer_ requirements
of [2] and therefore rational miners incentivized to execute scripts and verify transactions.

Thus motivated `MaxTxCost` can be used as default transaction limit when `tx.feeOut.R4` is
not specified by the sender. This is important for backward compatibility with existing
applications and in cases when estimation of `costLimit` is not possible (e.g. for
context-dependent scripts).

Miners' reward per unit of cost is `tx.feeOut.value / costLimit` in a worst case, and
rational miners are incentivized to order pool transactions by this reward ratio. 
Senders thus incentivized to estimate minimum possible `costLimit` and put it into
`tx.feeOut.R4`.

### Context-Independent Scripts

There is a large class of scripts which execution doesn't depend on the blockchain context
parameters (like `HEIGHT`, last `headers` etc.) (see references [[1]](#references)).  
For such _context-independent_ scripts the execution depends only on `tx` content (which
is immutable) and on nothing else. 

The "context independence" property of the script can be checked during de-serialisation
or by a single traverse of the ErgoTree. This can be done both _off-chain_ (in the client
side dApp) and _on-chain_ in the Ergo node by simply checking that the tree doesn't contain
forbidden (context related) operations.

Thus, if the dApp uses such "context independent" contracts, then it can predictably (and
deterministically) compute the `tx.accCost` value of verification cost of the
transaction. In this case neither the client nor the network bear the risks of
unexpectedly costly transaction execution and subsequent rejection by the network (wasting
time and resources). Note, the cost is computed as part of the transaction signing, which
should be done by the sender in any case. 

Thus an application can: 
  1) Evaluate scripts and obtain `tx.accCost` value.
  2) Choose `costPrice` value and store it in `tx.feeOut.R4`.
  3) Compute `tx.feeOut.value = tx.accCost * costPrice`.
  4) Sign the transaction and send it to the network.
  
Because all the scripts depend only on the transaction content, every verifier will always
finish `tx` verification with the same `tx.accCost` value. This means the transaction will
never be rejected as _over-limit_. This mechanism is transparent for the client dApp
implementation and no special ceremony has to be performed by the application. 
Existing applications, however, have to be upgraded to use this benefits. Before upgrade
the transactions with missing `tx.feeOut.R4` value will be processed with [maximum
transaction cost limit](#maximum-transaction-cost).

### New Costing of ErgoTree

Ethereum's contracts are compiled into bytecode instructions which are then executed by
Ethereum VM as part of a transaction execution. Each instruction has an associated cost
(aka 'gas') and the cost of the whole transaction is accrued as instructions are executed
one by one until either transaction complete or `gasLimit` is reached. In the later case
the transaction is aborted and the `gasLimit * gasPrice` number of Wei is transferred to
the miner.

In contrast, Ergo's approach is more light-weight and does not require using a _stateful_ VM
to execute contracts. Instead, the contracts are evaluated using _stateless_ interpreter and
thus many contracts can be evaluated in parallel.

For each input box of the transaction being validated:
1) The contract (stored in a box) is deserialized into ErgoTree data structure ready
for direct and efficient execution by the interpreter. 
2) A special Context data structure is created and passed to the interpreter
3) Interpreter evaluates the given contract in the given context.

The operations above can be done in parallel for all inputs, this is because interpreter
never mutates (or changes) the blockchain state.
In addition, the interpreter doesn't have direct access to the blockchain, and rely
solely on the Context to evaluate contracts.

The interpreter of the ErgoTree `t` is extended to accumulate the execution cost
`t.accCost` during evaluation all the tree nodes, and it checks that `t.accCost <=
costLimit` at any time.
Thus, upon completion of ErgoTree reduction, the result is a pair `(R, C1)`,
where `R` is a _Sigma Protocol Proposition Tree_ and `C1 = t.accCost` is the cost
accumulated during script reduction.
The resulting Sigma Protocol Proposition `R` must be further verified against proofs of
knowledge provided during transaction signing. The cost `C2` of `R` verification is
approximated by an Ahead Of Time costing without performing time-consuming crypto
operations. The resulting value `C1 + C2` is checked against `costLimit`.

If at any time the accumulated cost exceeds `costLimit`, then an exception is thrown,
which is interpreted as an _over-limit script_ as the transaction is rejected.

## Appendix A: AOT vs JIT Costing

### AOT Costing
Current implementation of block validation in Ergo (performed by every full node) implements
the first approach (i.e. AOT costing) shown in the following figure.
![AOT](eip5/AOT-costing.png)

AOT cost estimation happens for every
[ErgoTree](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf) of every input box of every
transaction in a block. The total accumulated cost of all the input scripts in the
block is limited by the `MaxBlockCost` parameter which can be adjusted by miners.

When a new block candidate is being assembled by a miner then for each new
transaction taken from the transaction pool the cost of running all input scripts is
being calculated.
The transaction is added to the block as long as the cost of all transactions in the block don't
exceed `MaxBlockCost` limit. When the cost is within the limit the transaction can be
added to the block candidate after it passes validation and all input ErgoTrees are
evaluated to `true`.

AOT cost estimation predicts the cost of the script execution ahead
of time in a given context. This approach is often used in blockchains with UTXO transaction
model and a simple, non-turing-complete contract language. 
The method work under assumption that cost estimation can be done much faster than
actual execution of the script. For non-turing-complete simple languages without looping
primitives, simple transaction context and only primitive types (like Bitcoin script) this
assumption is true. However for more complex languages like ErgoTree this is
increasingly not the case. The following is the list of limitations and drawbacks when the
AOT costing is applied to non-turing-complete (but still expressive language like ErgoScript).
 
##### AOTC Pros
1) No need to decide on the appropriate value for `gasLimit`
2) Transaction sender doesn't loose money in case the transaction is rejected due to the exceeded cost. 
3) Simple user-centric economy, where user only need to pay the fixed transaction fee,
defined dynamically by the current network usage (supply/demand ratio).
 
##### AOTC Cons

1) _It is complex_. Simple implementation is only possible for simple language (i.e.
primitive types, no collections, simple transaction context (again, no collections).
Adding collection types with at least the `map` operation leads to a much more complex
implementation if we still want to have expressive enough language. The `fold` operation
is even worse for AOT costing unless we strictly limit it to primitive aggregations.

2) _It is in accurate_. We don't know the exact execution trace of the script
ahead of time, in particular we cannot decide which branch of `if` statement will be
executed (since we don't know the result of condition expression) when the condition
depends on blockchain context such as current block height.
As a result we have to estimate both branches and take the maximum. This inherent estimation
error is multiplied when this `if` is part of the `map` operation. A similar approximation
has to be done if the script accesses an element of a collection by an index. If the
elements have complex structure (like INPUTS or OUTPUTS collections of boxes in
ErgoScript), then we have to approximate the size of the element we want to access. Even if
we abstract this size as just a number of bytes (which is very naive, and it didn't really
worked in ErgoScript), this number may lie in the range from hundred to 4K bytes. Thus we
may have an order of magnitude over-estimation of the actual execution cost (or
underestimation if we decide to use optimistic approximation).

3) _Low scalability_. Very limited number of transaction in a block due to
over-estimation. It turns out that poor cost approximation leads to over-estimation.
Because total cost of all transactions in a block must not exceed `MaxBlockCost` we can
put less transactions in the block which severely limits the maximum possible network
throughput.

4) _High overhead_. To prevent rare spam attacks the miners need to do extra computations
for executing benign scripts. And complex implementation of AOT costing (for expressive
ErgoTree language and transaction context) makes this overhead comparable to or even
exceeding the execution of the benign scripts themselves. Yes, we can quickly reject
high-cost scripts, but have to pay the double price for that everyday.

There are other technical difficulties, drawbacks and counter arguments for doing AOT
costing of contracts written in expressive language such as ErgoTree. However, the cons
list above should already be enough to motivate development of a better alternative,
combining advantage of both the extended UTXO model of Ergo and the simplicity of the JIT
costing.

### JIT Costing

An example of the JIT cost control (also called _dynamic_ cost control) is the Ethereum's
`gasLimit` checks performed during a transaction execution.

In Ethereum, every transaction must specify an amount of _"gas"_ that it is willing to
consume (called _gasLimit), and the fee that it is willing to pay per unit gas
(_gasPrice_). At the start of the transaction execution `gasLimit * gasPrice` of Ether are
removed from the transaction sender's account. All operations during transaction execution
and every computational step taken by the virtual machine consumes a certain quantity of
gas.

If a transaction execution processes fully, consuming less gas than its specified limit,
say with `gasRem` gas remaining, then the transaction executes normally, and at the end of
the execution the transaction sender receives a refund of `gasRem * gasPrice` and the miner
of the block receives a reward of `(gasLimit - gasRem) * gasPrice`. 

If a transaction "runs out of gas" mid-execution, then all execution reverts, but the
transaction is nevertheless valid, and the only effect of the transaction is to transfer
the entire sum `gasLimit * gasPrice` to the miner.

JIT costing has the following pros and cons.

##### JITC Pros
1) Additional Economic incentive for miners to execute contracts. The amount of purchase
from sender's account `(gasLimit - gasRem) * gasPrice` is payed to the miner, which
reflects the actual script execution costs.
2) Simple implementation using Cost Table for all VM commands and accumulation of the cost
along the execution trace.
3) Accurate approximation. Only actually executed operations are summed up. The execution
trace depends on the current state of the contract's data (i.e. current context) and
thus also the accumulated cost (i.e. `(gasLimit - gasRem)` value).
  
##### JITC Cons
1) Transaction sender will loose funds in case of exceeding `gasLimit`. In a
turing-complete language of Ethereum VM (byte code instruction set) it may be hard to
choose appropriate `gasLimit` to associate with the transaction. This is in particular
due to the point 3) in the Pros list. As a result, the transaction will be considered
invalid if actual (and unpredictably big) gas consumption exceeds `gasLimit`, in which
case the sender looses the funds.
2) The actual complexity of contracts may be limited by `gasPrice`.
Since all computations require gas, the usability of the contracts becomes limited by not
the language (which is powerful) and not the actual computation expenses of the miners, 
but by the current `gasPrice` asked by the miners. You would not want to spend more of your
funds for the gas required to execute a complex contract, than the amounts of funds you operate
with (i.e. sending $10 and pay $100 for the gas doesn't have economic sense).
    
## Appendix B: Benefits of JIT costing

1) When selecting transactions from the pool, a miner can quickly filter out transactions
that doesn't fit into `MaxBlockCost` using `costLimit = tx.feeOut.value / tx.feeOut.R4` when
R4 is specified.

2) In many cases (such as P2PK contracts and others) when the cost of transaction
validation doesn't depend on the context the cost of `tx` may be exactly predicted by the
sender (see [Context-Independent Scripts](#context-independent-scripts)). 
In such cases:
    - when R4 is provided by the sender the transaction will not be rejected as over-limit 
    - existing applications (which don't set R4) can be supported (without change) by 
    either 1) using reasonable and small default values of `costLimit` for p2pk scripts 
    or 2) using pessimistic `MaxTxCost` as default of `costLimit`.

3) In a long term, JIT costing enables an economic incentive to improve performance of
block validation including script evaluation. The miners are interested to put as much
transactions in every block as possible to maximize fee payments.
Considering the pool is full of transactions, the amount of transactions which can be put
into a new block is limited by a number of  parameters:
      - Block validation time is limited by 2 minutes tick interval between blocks. The
      time budget for block assembly and validation itself is the small fraction of this time
      (less than 5 seconds), as the block must also be distributed across the network and
      validated by all nodes. This is necessary to avoid network splits.
      - The maximum number of transactions in a block is limited by the `MaxBlockCost`
      network parameter. This parameter can be adapted by miners via voting, as long as
      the resulting blocks don't exceed the validation time limit.
      - `MaxTxCost` initially is small and conservative, which limits the maximal possible
      complexity of transactions. This allows to put more transaction in a block within a
      fixed `MaxBlockCost`. Thus, in order to increase complexity of transactions
      supported by the blockchain the following should be done:
        1) verifiers should improve computational efficiency of node software
        2) `MaxBlockCost` should be increased proportionally via voting
        3) `MaxTxCost` should be increased via voting 

Under these limits, miners and users as the community, are interested to improve throughput of block
assembly and validation software to process more transactions per second, with higher
total cost within the given time limits. The proposed JIT costing protocol for extended
UTXO model of Ergo enables a whole range of potential optimizations. This will be
especially important when the emission is over and the transaction fees along with storage
rent will be the only reward for miners.
