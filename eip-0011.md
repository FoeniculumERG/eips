EIP-11: Distributed Signatures
==============================

This EIP defines how to implement distributed signatures on top of the Ergo Platform.


Motivating Examples
-------------------

Alice, Bob and Carol are doing joint business and want to have joint control over funds as well. They decide that 2-out-of-3 quorum is enough to spend the joint funds, so there is no problem if one of them can not sign because of an illness or a vacation. Thus they do store funds in boxes protected by 2-out-of-3 threshold signature. 

Please note that unlike multi-signatures in Bitcoin, threshold signatures in Ergo preserve zero-knowledge. This leads to interesting applications where actual signers must be hidden but the signing ring is not. For example, it could be desirable to show that union paid to a lawyer, but it is better to hide who approved that spending.  

Sigma Protocols
---------------

A Sigma-protocol is three-step protocol between a prover and a verifier. First, prover is generating (secret) randomness and sends a commitment to it *a* to a verifier. The verifier is storing the commitment and sends a random challenge *e* to the prover. Prover is generating a response *z* based on the randomness and the challenge and sends it to the verifier. Verifier checks the tuple *(a,e,z)* and accepts it if it is valid. 

A Sigma-protocol can be converted to a signature scheme by using Fiat-Shamir transformation. Basically, using message *m*, prover can get challenge as *hash(m)* (note that this is about so-called Wek Fiat Shamir, while Ergo is using Strong Fiat-Shamir, where *e = hash(pk || m)*, and $pk$ is a statement (public key) the prover is proving).

Sigma protocol also allows for simulation of proofs, AND / OR / threshold conjectures. Good introductions can be found in the Chapter 6 of the "Efficient Secure Two-Party Protocols: Techniques and Constructions" book by Lindell and Hazay, and also in the tutorial by Ivan Damgard: https://cs.au.dk/~ivan/Sigma.pdf. 

For details on how proving and verification of arbitrary statements is done in ErgoTree (after reduction), see Appendix A in the ErgoScript whitepaper: https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf . 

Signing Procedure
-----------------

First, signing quorum should be decided. For example, Alice and Bob may decide to sign a transaction. Other parties (Carol in this case) will be simulated.

Then every real signer needs to generate commitments in the first place. In our example that means that e.g. Alice sends her commitment to Bob. 
On getting the Alice's commitment, Bob is produced a threshold signature where his tuple (a_B, e_B, z_B) is proper, Carol's tuple (a_C, e_C, z_C) is properly simulated as well, but for Alice's
(a_A, e_A', z_A') only the commitment is real, while other parts are simulated, thus the whole threshold signature is invalid. Bob needs for Alice to complete the signature.

Thus the Bob is sending (a_B, e_B, z_B, a_C, e_C, z_C) to Alice, and now she can provide a valid signature. 

In general case, signing procedure is as following:

* First, needed quorum of real participants to be decided. Please note that in case of 2-out-3 signature, there are just 2 and only 2 signers needed (a third one will be simulated anyway by the prover).
* Second, real participants generate commitments. In the simplest case, they can be sent to one of the signers.
* One signer is producing an invalid signature and sends simulated commitments and his commitment and response to others.
* Others produce proper responses and send them to the chosen signer (or broadcast)
* Now the signer can assemble a valid signature.

The most complex example at the moment of writing this document is 4-out-of-8 signature and it can be found in DistributedSigSpecification.scala of https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/pull/412 . 


Data Packets
------------

JSON documents are used for exchanging data needed for distributed signature generation.

JSON encoding transaction is already done in Ergo Platform reference client API, please check "UnsignedErgoTransaction" 
in [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/src/main/resources/api/openapi.yaml). 

A commitment (a) is about one secp256k1 element in case of prove-dlog (Schnorr signature) protocol, and two elements in 
case of prove-Diffie-Hellman-tuple protocol. Element encoded as Base16-encoded x-coordinate with a sign byte 
(of the y-coordinate) prepended, see ASN.1 for details (the only difference is that INF point encoded as 33 zero bytes). 

A challenge (e) is encoded as Base-16 encoded 256-bits (32-bytes) array.

Response (z) is 256-bits number encoded with Base16. 

A public key is encoded as one secp256k1 element in case of prove-dlog, four elements in case of 
prove-diffie-hellman-tuple:

    {
        "hint": "commitment",
        "index": 0,
        "type": "dlog",
        "real": true,
        "pk": "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c",
        "commitment": "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4"
    }

or    
    
    {
        "hint": "commitment",
        "type": "dht",
        "real": false,
        "pk": [
            "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c",
            "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c",
            "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c",
            "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c"
        ],  
        "commitment": [
            "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4",
            "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4"
        ]
    }

, where "index" is input index a hint is provided for. A partial signature can be encoded then as    

    {
         "hint": "partial-sig",
         "index": 0,
         "type": "dlog",
         "real": true,
         "pk": "03a73c66970f14fc6450c6ab1a167cb4ba3baa64b20f731e22ec6840c70d27ef1c",
         "commitment": "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4",                 
         "challenge": "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4",
         "response": "0253db866791af521ba4ab009509b6db89d272d9461636ee65eaa3e316884b21a4"
    }
    
and similarly for dht.    

Then we have two possible clients, stateful, which do store locally unsigned transactions and so can use transaction id 
in messages, and stateless, which do not store any information. Then in the stateless setting 
(reference protocol client will likely support only initially) signing request would be like current 
signing request for "/wallet/transaction/sign" API method. A signature and so transaction generated could be invalid 
(see "Signing Procedure" section). It is up to external utilities (or manual efforts) to gather needed hints for the 
prover.

Limitations
-----------

Please note that while threshold signatures preserve zero-knowledge (e.g. in case of 2-out-of-3 threshold signature it is 
known that two parties of out three at least signed an input, but not known who are these parties exactly) for a blockchain observer, participants of the signing group know who was involved in the signing process. Secrecy within the group can be achieved via MPC protocols.
