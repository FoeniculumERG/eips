## Motivation 

Act of exchange without trusted parties is a most basic primitive for decentralized finance on top of blockchains. Thus contracts for that were introduced early, and basic single-chain swap contract was introduced early in the [ErgoScript whitepaper](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf). Then a lot of other order contracts appeared: with partial filling, buyback guarantee and so on. What is good for traders in decentralized worlds, such contracts are usually composable. 
While swap order contracts allows for orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes), now popular AMM-based DEXes (where AMM stands for Automated Market Maker) are also possible on Ergo. 
Interestingly, unlike other known blockchains, thanks to the extended UTXO model, liquidity pool contracts for AMM-based DEXes can be combined with order contracts (for orderbook-based DEXes). This gives unique possibility to have shared liquidity among different types of exchanges on top of the Ergo blockchain. 

This PR provides a description of the Automated Decentralized Exchange protocol on top of the Ergo.

## Order-book DEX

Orders are waiting for another orders to be matched, or for a refund command. There're the following three types of orders — "buy" (i.e. buy tokens with ERG), "sell" (i.e. sell tokens for ERG), or "swap" (buy non-ERG tokens with other non-ERG tokens) orders. Order-book DEX has the advantage of working best for those pairs with high liquidity.

### Atomic orders

Atomic orders can only be executed completely. Such orders can be either be aggregated by the ErgoDEX client so that users can choose from them or matched with partial orders which will be defined next.

**Buy order [ERG -> Token]:**

```scala
{
  val user_pk = proveDlog(recipient);
  val deadline = SELF.creationInfo._1 + 30;

  val erg_amount = SELF.value - fee;
  val token_amount = erg_amount * rate / divisor;

  val valid_height = HEIGHT < deadline;

  sigmaProp(OUTPUTS.exists({ (box: Box) =>
    allOf(Coll(
      if (valid_height) {
        val t = box.tokens(0);
        t._1 == token_id &&
        t._2 >= token_amount
      } else {
        // refund
        box.value >= erg_amount
      },
      box.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == SELF.id,
      box.propositionBytes == user_pk.propBytes
    ))
  }))
}
```

**Sell order [Token -> ERG]:**

```scala
{
  val user_pk = proveDlog(recipient);
  val deadline = SELF.creationInfo._1 + 30;

  val self_tokens = SELF.tokens;
  val token_amount = self_tokens(0)._2;
  val erg_amount = token_amount * rate / divisor;

  val valid_height = HEIGHT < deadline;

  sigmaProp(OUTPUTS.exists({ (box: Box) =>
    allOf(Coll(
      if (valid_height) {
        box.value >= erg_amount
      } else {
        // refund
        box.tokens == self_tokens
      },
      box.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == SELF.id,
      box.propositionBytes == user_pk.propBytes
    ))
  }))
}
```

**Swapping two tokens [TokenX -> TokenY]:**
    
```scala
{
  val user_pk = proveDlog(recipient);
  val deadline = SELF.creationInfo._1 + 30;

  val self_tokens = SELF.tokens;
  val token_amount = self_tokens(0)._2;
  val other_token_amount = token_amount * rate / divisor;

  val valid_height = HEIGHT < deadline;

  sigmaProp(OUTPUTS.exists({ (box: Box) =>
    allOf(Coll(
      if (valid_height) {
        val t = box.tokens(0);
        t._1 == other_token_id &&
        t._2 >= other_token_amount
      } else {
        // refund
        box.tokens == self_tokens
      },
      box.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == SELF.id,
      box.propositionBytes == user_pk.propBytes
    ))
  }))
}    
```

### Orders with partial filling support:

Partial orders are something more familiar to those who've ever used classical CEX'es. These orders can be partially executed so the best way to work with them is an order-book, where they can be aggregated, matched and executed by ErgoDEX bots.

**Buy order [ERG -> Token]:**
    
```scala
{
    val PrecisionConstant = 1000000000L

    val quoteId     = SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get // R4 - quote tokenId
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes
    val maybeRewardToken         = maybeRewardBox.tokens(0)

    val rewardTokens =
        if (isValidRewardProposition && maybeRewardToken._1 == quoteId) maybeRewardToken._2
        else 0L

    val hasResidualBox             = OUTPUTS.size > 1
    val maybeResidualBox           = OUTPUTS(1)
    val isValidResidualProposition = maybeResidualBox.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes
    val isValidResidualRegisters   =
        maybeResidualBox.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == quoteId &&
        maybeResidualBox.R5[Long].get       == price &&
        maybeResidualBox.R6[Long].get       == feePerToken

    val validResidualBoxExists = hasResidualBox && isValidResidualProposition && isValidResidualRegisters

    val leftErgs =
        if (validResidualBoxExists) maybeResidualBox.value
        else 0L

    val feeCharged    = rewardTokens * feePerToken
    val isValidReward = rewardTokens.toBigInt * PrecisionConstant >= (SELF.value.toBigInt - feeCharged - leftErgs) * PrecisionConstant / price

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
}
```

**Sell order [Token -> ERG]:**
    
```scala
{
    val baseId      = SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get // R4 - quote tokenId
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes

    val ergs0 = SELF.value
    val ergs1 =
        if (isValidRewardProposition) maybeRewardBox.value
        else 0L

    val deltaErgs = ergs1 - ergs0

    val hasResidualBox             = OUTPUTS.size > 1
    val maybeResidualBox           = OUTPUTS(1)
    val maybeResidualAsset         = maybeResidualBox.tokens(0)
    val isValidResidualProposition = maybeResidualBox.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes
    val isValidResidualAsset       = maybeResidualAsset._1 == baseId
    val isValidResidualRegisters   =
        maybeResidualBox.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == baseId &&
        maybeResidualBox.R5[Long].get       == price &&
        maybeResidualBox.R6[Long].get       == feePerToken

    val validResidualBoxExists = hasResidualBox && isValidResidualProposition && isValidResidualAsset && isValidResidualRegisters

    val tokens0 = SELF.tokens(0)._2
    val tokens1 =
        if (validResidualBoxExists) maybeResidualAsset._2
        else 0L

    val soldTokens = tokens0 - tokens1

    val feeCharged    = soldTokens * feePerToken
    val isValidReward = deltaErgs.toBigInt >= soldTokens.toBigInt * price - feeCharged

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
}   
```

### On-chain matching vs Off-chain

It is not neccessary to publish orders on chain in order for them to be matched. ErgoDEX bots can synchronize orders off-chain, match them and only then execute in chained transactions.

## Automated Liquidity Pools

Unlike order-book based DEX which relies on an order-book to represent liquidity and determine prices AMM DEX uses an automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and slippage. AMM DEX suits best for pairs with low liquidity.

Each AMM liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair of assets. In order to facilitate trades a liquidity pool accepts deposits of underlying assets proportional to their price rates. Whenever deposit happens a proportional amount of unique tokens known as liquidity tokens is minted. Minted liquidity tokens are distributed among liquidity providers proportional to their deposits. Liquidity providers can later exchange their liquidity tokens share for a proportional amount of underlying reserves. 

### Ergo AMM DEX Contracts [Arbitrary Pairs]

Ergo AMM DEX relies on two types of contracts:

- Pool contracts
- Swap contracts

#### Pool contracts

Pool contract ensures the following operations are performed according to protocol rules:

- Depositing. An amount of LP tokens taken from LP reserves is proportional to an amount of underlying assets deposited. `LP = min(X_deposited * LP_supply / X_reserved, Y_deposited * LP_supply / Y_reserved)`
- Redemption. Amounts of underlying assets redeemed are proportional to an amount of LP tokens returned. `X_redeemed = LP_returned * X_reserved / LP_supply`, `Y_redeemed = LP_returned * Y_reserved / LP_supply`
- Swap. Tokens are exchanged at a price corresponding to a relation of a pair’s reserve balances while preserving constant product constraint (`CP = X_reserved * Y_reserved`). Correct amount of protocol fees is paid (0.03% currently). `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * 997 / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * 997)`

#### Liquidity pool bootstrapping

A liquidity pool is bootstrapped in two steps:

1. In order to track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves of a new pair a unique token must be issued. As soon as tokens can’t be re-issued on Ergo the whole LP emission has to be done at once. A distribution of emitted tokens is controlled by the pool contract.
2. In order to start facilitating trades a liquidity pool must be initialised by depositing initial amounts of pair assets. For the initializing deposit the amount of LP tokens is calculated using special formula which is `LP = sqrt(X_deposited, Y_deposited)`.

In order to avoid blowing up the pool contract with a code which handles only specific intialization aspects a dedicated type of contract is used.

#### Tracking pool identity

In order to preserve pool uniqueness a non-fungible token (NFT) is used. Then concrete pool can be identified by a unique NFT containing in pool UTXO.
Pool NFT is created at pool initialization stage. The pool bootstrapping contract ensures this step is done correctly.

Structure of pool bootstrapping UTXO:

Section   | Description
value     | Constant amount of ERGs
tokens[0] | LP token reserves
 
Pool bootstrapping contract:

```scala
{
    val SuccessorScriptHash = $ergoSwapScriptHash // Regular ErgoSwapAMM contract hash.
    
    val liquidityTokenId = SELF.id

    def reservedLP(box: Box): Long = {
        val maybeShares = box.tokens(0)
        if (maybeShares._1 == liquidityTokenId) maybeShares._2
        else 0L
    }

    val successor = OUTPUTS(0)

    val isValidContract  = blake2b256(successor.propositionBytes) == SuccessorScriptHash
    val isValidErgAmount = successor.value >= SELF.value
    val isValidPoolNFT   = successor.tokens(1) == (SELF.id, 1)

    val isValidInitialDepositing = {
        val depositedX   = successor.tokens(2)._2
        val depositedY   = successor.tokens(3)._2
        val desiredShare = successor.R4[Long].get
        val validDeposit = depositedX * depositedY == desiredShare * desiredShare     // S = sqrt(X_deposited * Y_deposited) Deposits satisfy desired share
        val validShares  = reservedLP(successor) >= (reservedLP(SELF) - desiredShare) // valid amount of liquidity shares taken from reserves
        validDeposit && validShares
    }
    
    sigmaProp(isValidContract && isValidErgAmount && isValidPoolNFT && isValidInitialDepositing)
}
```

Structure of pool UTXO:

Section   | Description
value     | Constant amount of ERGs
tokens[0] | LP token reserves
tokens[1] | Pool NFT
tokens[2] | Asset X
tokens[3] | Asset Y
R4[Long]  | Desired share (Required only at initialisation stage)

Pool contract:

```scala
{
    val InitiallyLockedLP = 1000000000000000000L

    val ergs0       = SELF.value
    val reservedLP0 = SELF.tokens(0)
    val poolNFT0    = SELF.tokens(1)
    val tokenX0     = SELF.tokens(2)
    val tokenY0     = SELF.tokens(3)

    val successor = OUTPUTS(0)

    val ergs1       = successor.value
    val reservedLP1 = successor.tokens(0)
    val poolNFT1    = successor.tokens(1)
    val tokenX1     = successor.tokens(2)
    val tokenY1     = successor.tokens(3)

    val isValidSuccessor = successor.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes
    val isValidErgs      = ergs1 >= ergs0
    val isValidPoolNFT   = poolNFT1 == poolNFT0
    val isValidLP        = reservedLP1._1 == reservedLP0._1
    val isValidPair      = tokenX1._1 == tokenX0._1 && tokenY1._1 == tokenY0._1

    val supplyLP0 = InitiallyLockedLP - reservedLP0._2
    val supplyLP1 = InitiallyLockedLP - reservedLP1._2

    val reservesX0 = tokenX0._2
    val reservesY0 = tokenY0._2
    val reservesX1 = tokenX1._2
    val reservesY1 = tokenY1._2

    val deltaSupplyLP   = supplyLP1 - supplyLP0 // optimize? reservedLP0._2 - reservedLP1._2
    val deltaReservesX  = reservesX1 - reservesX0
    val deltaReservesY  = reservesY1 - reservesY0

    val isValidDepositing = {
        val sharesUnlocked = min(
            deltaReservesX.toBigInt * supplyLP0 / reservesX0,
            deltaReservesY.toBigInt * supplyLP0 / reservesY0
        )
        -deltaSupplyLP <= sharesUnlocked
    }

    val isValidRedemption = {
        val shareLP = deltaSupplyLP.toBigInt / supplyLP0
        // note: shareLP and deltaReservesX, deltaReservesY are negative
        deltaReservesX >= shareLP * reservesX0 && deltaReservesY >= shareLP * reservesY0
    }

    val isValidSwap =
        if (deltaReservesX > 0)
            -deltaReservesY <= (reservesY0.toBigInt * deltaReservesX * 997) / (reservesX0.toBigInt * 1000 + deltaReservesX * 997) // todo: better precision const?
        else
            -deltaReservesX <= (reservesX0.toBigInt * deltaReservesY * 997) / (reservesY0.toBigInt * 1000 + deltaReservesY * 997)

    val isValidAction =
        if (deltaSupplyLP == 0)
            isValidSwap
        else
            if (deltaReservesX > 0 && deltaReservesY > 0) isValidDepositing
            else isValidRedemption

    sigmaProp(
        isValidSuccessor &&
        isValidErgs &&
        isValidPoolNFT &&
        isValidLP &&
        isValidPair &&
        isValidAction
    )
}
```

#### Swap contracts

Swap contract ensures a swap is executed fairly from a user's perspective. The contract checks that:
* Assets are swapped at actual price derived from pool reserves. `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * 997 / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * 997)`
* A minimal amount of quote asset received as an output in order to prevent front-running attacks.

Once published swap contracts are tracked and executed by ErgoDEX bots automatically. Until a swap is executed it can be cancelled by a user who created it by simply spending the swap UTXO.

Swap contract:

```scala
{
    val Pk = $pk

    val PoolScriptHash = $poolScriptHash

    val MinQuoteAmount = $minQuoteAmount
    val QuoteId        = $quoteId
    
    val base       = SELF.tokens(0)
    val baseId     = base._1
    val baseAmount = base._2

    val poolInput  = INPUTS(0)
    val poolAssetA = poolInput.tokens(2)
    val poolAssetB = poolInput.tokens(3)

    val isValidPoolInput =
        blake2b256(poolInput.propositionBytes) == PoolScriptHash &&
        (poolAssetA._1 == QuoteId || poolAssetB._1 == QuoteId) &&
        (poolAssetA._1 == baseId  || poolAssetB._1 == baseId)

    val isValidSwap =
        OUTPUTS.exists { (box: Box) =>
            val quoteAsset  = box.tokens(0)
            val quoteAmount = quoteAsset._2
            val isFairPrice =
                if (poolAssetA._1 == QuoteId)
                    quoteAmount >= (poolAssetA._2 * baseAmount * 997) / (poolAssetB._2 * 1000 + baseAmount * 997)
                else
                    quoteAmount >= (poolAssetB._2 * baseAmount * 997) / (poolAssetA._2 * 1000 + baseAmount * 997)

            box.propositionBytes == Pk.propBytes &&
            quoteAsset._1 == QuoteId &&
            quoteAsset._2 >= MinQuoteAmount &&
            isFairPrice
        }

    sigmaProp(Pk || (isValidPoolInput && isValidSwap))
}
```
